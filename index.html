    <ul type="disc" class="second">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using the style elements in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

    <p class="second">in CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elemets on a web page. Once an elemet hsa been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element</p>
